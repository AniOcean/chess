# chess
chess game i made, this is the client code. there's a server running and the chess.exe should connect and work fine with it
there's an .exe file if you want to play on my server.

chess_objects.py and chess_utilities.py 
have all of logic of the chess game itself (like moves, checkmate chescks, stalemate and stuff like that so you can use it for whatever.
