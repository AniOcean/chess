hi, this is an online chess game :)

you can use any of the code in here for whatever.

run the chess.exe file to start. there probably wont be any online players but you can try.
if you dont trust me, you can look at the main_client code, and run it instead of chess.exe (its the same thing but not an exe file but you might be needed to download some modules).

this is a project of mine that is not really done yet, so there are alot of missing things but the most should work alright.
